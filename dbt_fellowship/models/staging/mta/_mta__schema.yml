      Staged data from the MTA Origin-Destination Ridership Estimate: 2023 dataset (https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Origin-Destination-Ridership-Estimate-2/uhf3-t34z/about_data).
      Documentation is copied directly from the data dictionary and table is filtered to timestamp = "'2023-01-02T00:00:00'".

      This dataset provides an estimate of subway travel patterns based on scaled-up OMNY and MetroCard return swipe data. It provides estimated passenger volumes for all populated origin-destination 
      (O-D) pairs aggregated by month, day of the week, and hour of day. It also provides the name, ID, and approximate latitude and longitude of the origin and destination subway complexes.
    columns: 
      - name: origin_month
        description: The month in which the subway trips occurred.
      - name: origin_day_of_week
        description: The day of the week on which the subway trips occurred (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
      - name: origin_hour_of_day
        description: The hour of the day in which the subway trips occurred. All trip times are rounded down to the nearest hour.
      - name: origin_timestamp
        description: Representative datetime for the year, month, day of week, and hour of day in which the subway trips occurred. This date will be from the first full week of the month.
      - name: origin_station_complex_id
        description: The unique identifier for the subway station complex where the trips originated.
      - name: origin_station_complex_name
        description: The name of the subway station complex where the trips originated.
      - name: destination_station_complex_id
        description: The unique identifier for the subway station complex where the trips are inferred to have ended.
      - name: destination_station_complex_name
        description: The name of the subway station complex where the trips are inferred to have ended.
      - name: estimated_average_ridership
        description: The estimated ridership for an origin-destination pair and hour of day, averaged by day of week over the calendar month.
