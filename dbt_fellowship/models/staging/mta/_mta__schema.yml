      Staged data from the MTA Subway Hourly Ridership dataset (https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-Beginning-February-202/wujg-7c2s/about_data).
      Documentation copied directly from the MTA Data Dictionary, and filtered to transit_timestamp = "'2023-01-02T00:00:00'".
    columns:
      - name: "transit_timestamp"
        description: >
          Timestamp payment took place in local time. All transactions here are rounded down to the nearest
          hour. For example, a swipe that took place at 1:37pm will be reported as having taken place at 1pm.

        description: Distinguishes between the subway, Staten Island Railway, and the Roosevelt Island Tram
      - name: "station_complex_id"
        description: A unique identifier for station complexes
      - name: "station_complex"
        description: >
          The subway complex where an entry swipe or tap took place. Large subway complexes, such as Times Square
          and Fulton Center, may contain multiple subway lines. The subway complex name includes the routes that stop 
          at the complex in parenthesis, such as Zerega Av (6).
      - name: "payment_method"
        description: Specifies whether the payment method used to enter was from OMNY or MetroCard.
      - name: "fare_class_category"
        description: >
          The class of fare payment used for the trip. The consolidated categories are:
          • MetroCard (Fair Fare)
          • MetroCard (Full Fare)
          • MetroCard (Other)
          • MetroCard (Senior & Disability)
          • MetroCard (Students)
          • MetroCard (Unlimited 30-Day)
          • MetroCard (Unlimited 7-Day)
          • OMNY (Full Fare)
          • OMNY (Other)
          • OMNY (Seniors & Disabilities)
      - name: "ridership"
        description: >
          Total number of riders that entered a subway complex via OMNY or MetroCard at the specific hour and for that
          specific fare type.
      - name: "transfers"
        description: >
          Number of individuals who entered a subway complex via a free bus-to-subway, or free out-of-network
          transfer. This represents a subset of total ridership, meaning that these transfers are already included in the
          preceding ridership column. Transfers that take place within a subway complex (e.g., individuals transferring
          from the 2 to the 4 train within Atlantic Avenue) are not captured here.
  - name: stg_origin_destination_20230102
    description: >
      Staged data from the MTA Origin-Destination Ridership Estimate: 2023 dataset (https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Origin-Destination-Ridership-Estimate-2/uhf3-t34z/about_data).
      Documentation is copied directly from the data dictionary and table is filtered to timestamp = "'2023-01-02T00:00:00'".

      This dataset provides an estimate of subway travel patterns based on scaled-up OMNY and MetroCard return swipe data. It provides estimated passenger volumes for all populated origin-destination 
      (O-D) pairs aggregated by month, day of the week, and hour of day. It also provides the name, ID, and approximate latitude and longitude of the origin and destination subway complexes.
    columns: 
      - name: origin_month
        description: The month in which the subway trips occurred.
      - name: origin_day_of_week
        description: The day of the week on which the subway trips occurred (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).
      - name: origin_hour_of_day
        description: The hour of the day in which the subway trips occurred. All trip times are rounded down to the nearest hour.
      - name: origin_timestamp
        description: Representative datetime for the year, month, day of week, and hour of day in which the subway trips occurred. This date will be from the first full week of the month.
      - name: origin_station_complex_id
        description: The unique identifier for the subway station complex where the trips originated.
      - name: origin_station_complex_name
        description: The name of the subway station complex where the trips originated.
      - name: destination_station_complex_id
        description: The unique identifier for the subway station complex where the trips are inferred to have ended.
      - name: destination_station_complex_name
        description: The name of the subway station complex where the trips are inferred to have ended.
      - name: estimated_average_ridership
        description: The estimated ridership for an origin-destination pair and hour of day, averaged by day of week over the calendar month.
